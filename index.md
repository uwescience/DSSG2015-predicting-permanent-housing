The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, together with [Building Changes](http://www.buildingchanges.org/) have partnered with King, Pierce and Snohomish counties to make homelessness in these counties rare, brief and one-time. The goal of this project was to <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-predicting-permanent-housing/2015-08-06-multi-stakeholder-collaboration/">take part in this multi-stakeholder collaboration</a>, and to analyze data about enrollments of homeless families in these counties in programs serving the homeless population, to identify factors that predicted whether families would succeed in finding permanent housing, and to investigate the ways families transition between different programs and different episodes of homelessness.

We developed algorithms to <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2015-predicting-permanent-housing/2015-07-27-chris-galaxy-clusters/">identify families</a> from the individual enrollments and to identify 'episodes' of homelessness including back-to-back, or overlapping enrollments in individual programs. We devised innovative ways to visualize and analyze the ways families move from program to program through different programs, including interactive [Sankey diagrams](tinyurl.com/dssg-homeless) and trajectory plots (see below). These visualizations were particularly interesting and helpful to the county data leads, who have already used them to identify sources of coding errors and to evaluate some of their programs.

<figcaption> <strong> Program trajectories are a series of programs that a family encounters during a contiguous episode of homelessness. Common trajectories lead to different outcomes at the end of enrollment: a successful exit from an episode (proportion designated in blue) would mean that the family found a permanent housing solution. Some of these (proportions in green) still receive government subsidies. Other exits (in red) are exits back into homelessness, or to other, unknown destinations </strong></figcaption>
